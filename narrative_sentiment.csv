"Instructors should avoid getting a lot of panel members and panel members who are not even knowledgeable about the topic. I think that 3ï¿½4 panel members are already enough; you don't even need 7ï¿½10 people per presentation. It is also an additional burden for students because they provide food and drinks for them. Additionally, instructors should avoid getting panel members who have zero or minimal knowledge of the subject; they end up giving low grades to the students just because they couldn't grasp the concepts and requirements of the subject.

Thus we hope to have more student safe spaces. Also, the services offered from the cashier, accounting and registrar during the enrollment process is very impractical when a transaction can be done in just a day but takes us a long timeï¿½ because of the reason that the school is overcrowded, yet they lack in manpower.

"Ang daming resources at services aimed at enhancing students' academic success and overall learning experience. - Let the students choose their own groups whenever there are group tasks to avoid conflicts as well as to ensure that they will be more productive since they like who they are working with (although you might say that in the real world, you cannot choose who to work). I feel like a student can unleash his or her full potential in an environment that he or she is confident and comfortable with. - The school tends to be lenient in implementing rules and regulations among students. In this case, students do not learn from their mistakes, and they choose to make these mistakes their habit instead. The policies on the student handbook are not properly observed and practiced. - There shall be a more conducive space for learning and resting. Some students have long vacant hours, and the campus lacks space that can accommodate students who are waiting for their next class. Some facilities do not have stable internet connections, are too hot, or are very crowded.",ang dame resourc servic aim enhanc student academ success overal learn experi let student choos group whenev group task avoid conflict well ensur product sinc like work although might say real world cannot choos work feel like student unleash full potenti environ confid comfort school tend lenient implement rule regul among student case student learn mistak choos make mistak habit instead polici student handbook properli observ practic shall conduc space learn rest student long vacant hour campu lack space accommod student wait next class facil stabl internet connect hot crowd,-3,negative
